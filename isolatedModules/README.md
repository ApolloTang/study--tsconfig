# IsolateModule



Babel transpiler treats each file as an isolated module without being aware of the context of this module in a project. Consider the following:

**listing 1**

```typescript
/// file: babel7/1a-no-transpiler-error/src/export-import.ts

import { someFunction } from "./some-module";
import { foo } from "./some-module";
//       ^^^
//       In isolation, Babel have no way to tell the variable 'foo' is not a value

export { someFunction };
export { foo };

```

When Babel analyses the file in isolation, it cannot tell if the variable `foo` being imported is a value or a type.  

Consider if `foo` is  exported and then consumed by another module:

**listing 2**

```typescript
/// file: babel7/1a-isolateModule-false/src/main.ts

import { someFunction } from './export-import'
import { foo } from './export-import'
//       ^^^ <-- we don't know if this variable is a value or a type

console.log('someFunction(): ', someFunction())
console.log('foo: ', foo)
//                   ^^^
//                   [tsserver 2693] 'foo' only refers
//                   to a type, but is being used as a value here. [E]
console.log('finished execution')
```

In the above, IDE tells you that `foo` is a type, but you use it as a value. During execution, this should be a [*ReferenceError*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Undeclared_var):

```text
ReferenceError: foo is not defined
```

However, executing the Babel's transpiled javascript you get:

The execution of Babel's transpiled javascript is incorrect because `foo` only exists in the typescript space. In the javascript space, it was never declared. Using an undeclared variable will result in a ReferenceError. A script with ReferenceError should throw. This discrepancy exists because *Babel transpiler does not do type check; it ignores `tsconfig.json` and simply transpiles the typescript syntax to javascript.*  Your IDE, however, is using the typescript transpiler (typescript language server, to be more exact). Typescript transpiler is aware of the context for each file in the project; therefore, it can figure out you are attempting to use a type as value.



### Name type explicitly

One way to help prevent the above error is to **name our type explicitly**:

**listing 3**

```typescript
///file: babel7/1b-naming-type-explicitly/build/main.js

import { someFunction } from './export-import'
import { fooType } from './export-import'
//       ^^^^^^^ <-- the name tells us this variable is a type

console.log('someFunction(): ', someFunction())
console.log('fooType: ', fooType)  // <-- this is obviously a runtime error
//                       ^^^^^^^
//                       [tsserver 2693] 'fooType' only refers
//                       to a type, but is being used as a value here. [E]
console.log('finished execution')
```

By naming `foo` to  `fooType,` we can catch ourself making a mistake using a type as a value.



### Re-exporting a type

Explicitly naming the variable can help, but it will not solve incorrect Babel's transpiled javascript. The root of the problem is not where `fooType` or `foo` is being used as a value. The problem is in **listing 1** that we are *re-exporting an imported type*. We can see the problem in the transpiled code:

**listing 4**

```js
///file: babel7/1a-isolateModule-false/build/export-import.js

"use strict";

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true
});
Object.defineProperty(exports, "foo", {
  enumerable: true,
  get: function get() {
    return _someModule.foo;
  }
});
Object.defineProperty(exports, "someFunction", {
  enumerable: true,
  get: function get() {
    return _someModule.someFunction;
  }
});

var _someModule = require("./some-module");
```

Notice that the Babel is treating `foo` as a value (line 8). The variable `foo` is a type, and it should never have been present in the transpiled javascript.

The following is the similar code transpiled by the typescript transpiler, and you see that  `foo` is absent:

**listing 5**

```js
///file: tsc/1a--isolateModule-false/build/export-import.js

"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.someFunction = void 0;
var some_module_1 = require("./some-module");
Object.defineProperty(exports, "someFunction", {
  enumerable: true,
  get: function () {
    return some_module_1.someFunction;
  },
});
```

The reason Babel can mistakenly include type in the transpiled code is that Babel transpiler only works with individual files;* it does not see a system of files in a project*.



### compilerOptions.isolatedModules and the type keyword

When using Babel as a transpiler we should set the `compilerOptions.isolatedModules` to `true` in tsconfig.json (the default value is `false`):

```jsonc
/// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "isolatedModules": true
    ...
  }
}
```

With isolateModule set to true, you are telling the typescript compiler in your IDE that you are using Babel, and it should deal with each typescript file in isolation instead of it being part of a project -- with this, you see an additional type error:

```typescript
/// file: babel7/1c-isolatedModules-true/src/export-import.ts

import { someFunction } from "./some-module";
import { fooType } from "./some-module";

export { someFunction };
export { fooType };  // <--- IDE tells us this can lead to mistake
//       ^^^^^^^
//       [tsserver 1205] Re-exporting a type when the '--isolatedModules'
//       flag is provided requires using 'export type'
```

The message tells us that we should use the keyword `type` during exporting. The `type` keyword is a feature since **typescript version 3.8** and **Babel version 7.9(~?)**. Annotate the `import` and `export` statement with `type` keyword on. the intend is clear:

```typescript
import { someFunction } from "./some-module";
import type { fooType } from "./some-module";

export { someFunction };
export type { fooType };
```

And the the run time is correct:

<img src="./babel7/1d-isolatedModules-true-with-type-keyword/documents/isolatedModules-true-with-type-keyword.png" width="520px" />

This is because Babel's transpiled javascript is now correct:

```js
///file: babel7/1d-isolatedModules-true-with-type-keyword/build/export-import.js

"use strict";

Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", {
  value: true
});
Object.defineProperty(exports, "someFunction", {
  enumerable: true,
  get: function get() {
    return _someModule.someFunction;
  }
});

var _someModule = require("./some-module");
```
